/* heroCategory = 0x1 << 0
 0x1 is a hexadecimal 1
 << is the bitwise (meaning: designating an operator in a programming language that manipulates the individual bits in a byte or word) left shift operator
 0 is how many bits (an amount) places to shift to the left.
 In this case, take the value 1 and shift it 0 places left. So heroCategory = 1. (equations)
 You would write it out this way to keep consistency when writing out a lot of masks together.
 obstacleCategory = 0x1 << 1;
 Shift the Value 1, 1 bit to the left. So obstacleCategory = 2.*/

 With SKAction, you can do a lot of things such as move up or down, shrink, grow, turn around
 To see how and what to do you can go to Help feom XCode, then click Documentation and API Reference about SKAction */
